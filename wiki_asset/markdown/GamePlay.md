When you gain exp with revealed weapon or chest in your slots including 
`mainhand`, `offhand` and `chest`, 
The exp will be evenly distributed among these items. 
These overflowing exp will gained by yourself.

It is worth noting that (as an example) when your have revealed weapons in your mainhand and offhand, 
your weapon in one of your hands can only gain half of exp you get, although the 
weapon in your offhand is already the Max Level! 
This is as the same as Warframe.
