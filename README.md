The status chance based on your weapon!

### Critical Attack
Different weapon has different critical chance and critical damage.
An attack rating exceeding 100% will increase the level of critical hits, 
which shows no matter how high the critical hit rate is, it is always useful.

### Enhancing Your Projectile Weapon
There is no invulnerable time for your projectile weapon.

## A New Hurt Absorb Method for All Entity
This mod has changed the effectiveness of your armor and armor toughness.
`A=Armor`„ÄÅ`T=Toughness`,`X=A*(4+T)`:
You will have a basic damage reduction = `X/(X+40)`, 
and high damage will reduce the effectiveness of your defense.

## A New Hurt Absorb Method for Your Targets
Your Targets will have different health material, 
which has different resistances to different damage types.
For example, Impact Damage is useful to Skeleton and other entities
are of Bone health material.

## Mods
You can change your weapon and chest by different mods.
For your favorite weapon, you can equip it with specialized Riven mod.
This module is almost as the same as Warframe.

## Know How Many Damage You Make
The damage number will be displayed when you make damage.
